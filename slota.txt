EXPERIMENT-02 
Hiding and extracting a text file behind an 
image file. 
Aim of the Experiment: 
To study the steps for hiding and extract any text file behind an image file using 
Command Prompt.  
Any file like .rar .jpg .txt or any file can be merged inside another file. In a 
simple way, we shall learn how to hide a text file inside an image file using the 
Command Prompt.  
How to Hide the FILE?  
Suppose you have to hide a text file “A.txt” with the image file “B.jpg” and 
combine them in a new file as “C.jpg”.  Where “C.jpg” is our output file which 
contains the text hidden in the image file.  
Follow the steps:  
1. copy the file need to hide, to desktop (for our tutorial let us assume the 
file to be "A.txt") 
2. copy the image, within which you need to hide the file, to desktop (let it 
be "B.jpg") 
3. now open the cmd: >ctrl+r >type: cmd and hit enter  
4. in cmd first type the code as follows: >cd desktop NOTE: this code is for 
assigning the location on cmd to desktop  
5. Now type the following code:  
copy /b B.jpg + A.txt C.jpg 
Syntax: copy /b Name-of-file-containing-text-you-want-to-hide.txt + 
Name-of-initial- image.jpg Resulting-image-name.jpg  
"C.jpg" is the output image inside this out image our file is hidden  
How to retrieve the file?  
1. locate C.jpg file from where you want to retrieve text data  
2. Right-click and open with notepad 
Done! Successfully opened! In the last of the notepad, you’ll find the content of 
the text file.  
Hide A Message into Image: 
1. Open Run command window by pressing win + r.  
2. Open command prompt by typing cmd and press OK  
3. Enter the directory where you have your files.  
4. Then type the command: echo "Your Message">>"image.jpg" 
5. Now the message is successfully hidden in the image file. 
6. To view the message: Open with Notepad, at last, you’ll find the Your 
Message
